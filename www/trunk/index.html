<div id="titre">What is PAccMan ?</div>
PaccMan stands for Personal ACCount Manager. It is a very simple
account manager. I&nbsp;use it for my personal needs which are very
limited, so you may find that a few things - actually a lot ! - are
missing. Anyway, I hope
it will grow to match more and more needs. These <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=150658">screenshots</a>
will give you an overview of the currently supported features.<br>
It is written in&nbsp;java (version 6 or higher) and does not use
any&nbsp;platform dependant library. So&nbsp;it will hopefully
run&nbsp;on any platform supporting Java.<br>
To users<br>
PAccMan is not yet packaged. So you will need to download and install a
few extra things. If you want to try it anyway, follow the instructions
on <a href="setup.html">this page</a>.<br>
To developers<br>
PAccMan is still in early stage of development. <a href="devsetup.html">This
page</a> provides the
information you need if you want to participate.<br>
